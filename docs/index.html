<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    This project includes two parts: (1) Beizer Curves, and (2) Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure. 
    In the Bezier Curves part, I learn how to draw a curve by the control points of Beizer Curves. 
    Also, I implement Bezier Surfaces that can draw a surface on the screen. 
    In the second part, I learn how to use the half-edge data structure to represent an object. 
    Furthermore, I implement flip and split functions for further mesh upsampling.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    To implement Bezier curves, I implement Casteljau's algorithm. 
    Figure1 shows the concept of Casteljau's algorithm. 
    In the beginning, I have four control points b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>3</sub>, and b<sub>4</sub>. 
    After the first step, I use linear interpolation to get b<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup>, b<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>, and b<sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup>. 
    The points remaining are one less than before. 
    Then, I process the algorithm with the same approach that makes b<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup>, b<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>, and b<sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup> into b<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> and b<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> by linear interpolation. 
    This iteration will not stop until there is only one point left. 
    This point in Figure 1 is b<sub>0</sub><sup>3</sup> and the bezier curve we want will pass through this point.

<p>
    Figure 2 shows six white control points I selected. 
    To select six points, I modified the number of points in curve2.bzc and add one more point coordinate. 
    Figure 3 shows the bezier curve created by my implementation. 
    The blue points are the intermediate points calculated by linear interpolation. 
    The red point is the final point and the green line is the bezier curve.

    In Figure 10, I scroll the mouse and change the parameter t. 
    The result shows that the intermediate points move right because we calculate the next level point by linear interpolation ((1 - t) * b<sub>0</sub> + t * b<sub>1</sub>). 
    Modifying t means changing the next level points.

<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    In part 1, I create a bezier curve in 2D. In this part, I want to increase the bezier curve into a bezier surface in three dimensions.
    The concept of implementing a bezier surface is to first create a bezier curve across one dimension and then use these curves to create a bezier surface across two dimensions.
    Figure 12 and Figure 13 show the visualization of a bezier surface and the steps to create this bezier surface.
    When implementing a bezier surface, I first focus on the u-axis, then create multiple bezier curves and final points as part 1 using linear interpolation.
    After creating the bezier curves, I create other bezier curves focusing on the v-axis by linear interpolation.

<h2 align="middle">Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    In this part, I want to calculate the normal of a vertex.
    The concept of computing the normal is by iterating through all the faces that are connected to this vertex and calculating the area-weighted normal.
    In this project, the meshes are stored in the half-edge data structure.
    Therefore, getting all the neighboring triangles of the vertex is done by traversing all the half-edge.
    The process of getting all the neighbor half-edges is shown in Figure 15. Then I need to compute the normal of each triangle.
    To do so I use the cross product of two edge vectors in that triangle connected to the vertex.
    Also, I want to do area-weighting, this can also be done by the cross-product since the edge vectors include the size of the triangle.
    After adding all the normals, I perform normalization to get the average normal.

<b>

</b>
<p>
    Figure 15 and Figure 16 show the visualization of the teapot without and with vertex normals. 
    It is obvious that visualization with area-weighted vertex normal is smoother and more realistic. 
    This is because, without vertex normals, the normal of each vertex is not affected by neighbor triangles. 
    However, it is common that the neighbors have an impact on the vertex.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    In this part, I implement an edge flip operation using the half-edge data structure.
    The concept of edge flip is shown in Figure 18.
    The main idea is changing edge bc into edge ad.
    To do so, I follow the concept in Figure 19.
    The first step I do is to collect all the existing vertexes, edges, half-edges, and faces in the triangle.
    Since the edge flip operation does not create new items, I do not have to initialize any new elements.
    Then, I reassign the connection of all vertexes, edges, half-edges, and faces to match the result after an edge flip.
    The mapping between before an edge flip and after an edge flip is shown in the left part of Figure 19.

    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    When implementing the edge flip operation, I made some mistakes when assigning the new property of outer triangle half-edges after the edge flip. 
    The face of all the outer triangle half-edges should remain the same because the face they refer to is not the face in the current triangle. 
    However, I assigned them to current triangles. The result in Figure 22 shows the bug in my previous implementation. 
    There become some holes after two edge flips because the outside half-edges have the wrong faces.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    In this part, I implement another basic operation called edge split.
    This is a common operation when it comes to local mesh editing.
    The concept of edge split is shown in Figure 23.
    The procedure of edge split is similar to edge flip.
    First, I collect all the existing vertexes, edges, half-edges, and faces in the triangle.
    These elements are the building block of future operations.
    In contrast to edge flip, it is important to add new elements in edge split.
    These elements are vertex m and the half-edges that connect to vertex m.
    The position of m should be in the midpoint of point c and point b.
    Then, I reassign the relationship of each element to make sure these elements are located in the position after the edge split.
    One interesting implementation I do is in the collecting stage, I first assume m and b are in the same location.
    So that I can reduce some assignments because the edges connected to m and b can be reused.

    It turns out that the teapot after the edge split will result in holes that can see through the teapot. 
    When I am tracking the bug, I find out that it always has a problem in the bottom right side of the triangle. 
    Therefore I can locate the bug in that location.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    In this part, I implement loop subdivision. 
    Loop subdivision is a technique to upsample the 3D meshes. 
    I follow the concept of Figure 29, Figure 30, and Figure 31. 
    The first step to doing the loop subdivision is to compute the new position of all the vertexes in the mesh. 
    By traveling all the vertexes in the mesh, I compute the new position following the formula: (1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum. 
    Then, I have to update the position of all the edges following the formula: 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D). 
    After these steps, I have to split all the existing edges by edge split in part 4. 
    However, after the edge split, some edges may not be appropriate, therefore, I have to do edge flip on edges that connect between old and new vertexes. 
    In the end, I will update all the vertexes to old because they all existed after this loop.

<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    After subdivision, sharp corners and edges get smoothed out, but we also lose a lot of their volume.
    As shown in Figure 32 to Figure 35.
    The edges become smoother and smoother.
